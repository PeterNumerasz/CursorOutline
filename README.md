# 🎯 CursorOutline

**Never lose your cursor again.**

CursorOutline is a lightweight, efficient World of Warcraft addon designed to keep your mouse visible during the most chaotic raid encounters and Mythic+ runs.

If you struggle to spot your mouse pointer amidst spell effects, nameplates, and AoE explosions, this addon is the solution. It attaches a high-visibility texture (like the X marker, Skull, or Star) directly to your cursor.

## 🌟 Why use CursorOutline?

*   **Ultra Lightweight:** Zero CPU impact. It just works.
*   **Combat Focused:** Options to show only during combat to keep your UI clean.
*   **Highly Customizable:** Adjust the **Scale**, **Opacity**, and **Texture** to fit your preference.
*   **Safe & Conflict-Free:** Uses standalone textures, meaning it **does not** interfere with Raid Targets, DBM, BigWigs, or Method Raid Tools auto-marking.

## 🔄 An Alternative to StarCursor and CursorTrail

If you are looking for a modern, bloat-free **alternative to StarCursor**, **CursorTrail**, or **CursorMod**, this is it. Unlike heavy WeakAuras that do the same thing, CursorOutline is built purely for performance. It provides the visual clarity of **Cursor Glow** or **Mouse Look Handler** utilities without the complex setup.
